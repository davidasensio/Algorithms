/**
 * Introduction to Tailrec
 *   Some algorithms work best when implemented in a recursive manner â€“ where a computation is based on a simpler form of the same computation.
 *   In most programming languages, there is a risk of a stack overflow associated with recursion. There is a limit on the number of nested method calls that can be made in one go, without returning.
 *   If this is an issue, the algorithm can be re-written in an imperative manner, using a traditional loop instead.
 *   Tail recursion is a technique where the compiler can rewrite a recursive method in an imperative manner, assuming that certain rules are met.
 *
 * 2. Rules for Tail Recursion in Kotlin
 *   To implement a function in Kotlin using tail recursion, there is one rule to follow:
 *     the recursive call must be the very last call of the method.
 *   This rule is not as simple to follow as it seems.
